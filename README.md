Below, explain what a http request is.

# What I Learned: 
An HTTP request is a request sent by the client side (front end) to the server, telling it to grab a specific piece of data and do something with it depending on what the request is. It consists of the request line (HTTP Verb (GET,POST,DELETE,etc), URI (index.html), and HTTP version number) and a header/parameter.
